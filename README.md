# Yan85-Assembler
A simple python assembler for Yan85, the custom architecture used in several modules and challenges on pwn.college.

## Description
This is a simple assembler for Yan85, the custom architecture used in several pwn.college challenges. Given custom-written Yan85 shellcode, this assembler can reorder the instructions, break them down into their equivalent bytecode values, and send that bytecode into the challenge.

## Disclaimer to pwn.college students
Be aware that pwn.college staff monitors all code that is used on their infrastructure. Usage of this code *will* result in an academic integrity violation. A major hurdle of reverse engineering Yan85 is making your own assembler/disassembler/emulator; it's part of the fun. Good luck!
